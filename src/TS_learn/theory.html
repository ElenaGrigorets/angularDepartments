Components are the heart of angular app
Each would be a sort of independent piece, witch you can reuse
Another advantage is your code looks much nicer, then giant html page

The main questions to understand components are: how to pass information into component and how to
get out information from it, how they actually connected together and to outside world?
Data down, action up
from high-level component to low-level layer

{{}} interpolation means whatever variable you have inside component (.ts file), you can use it in the
template
[ngModel]
