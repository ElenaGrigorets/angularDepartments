1.Observables
There are two types of methods static and instance
Instance method combine latest :
so we create instance of an observable then we can use that operator on the observable instance itself
Static:
instead of calling the method on an instance we call it on the observable class itself and then we pass observables
to it as arguments
In rxjs some methods are only instance others are only static and some overlap for both
2. Subscriptions
That's haw you actually extract data from observables
3. Unsubscribe
4. Map observables
Map operator is very powerful, you can use it to transform any type of asynchronous data into the format that you want
5. switchMap
this allows us to handle data relationships that exist between two independent streams
6. combine Observables
7. behavior Subject
