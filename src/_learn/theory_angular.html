Components are the heart of angular app
Each would be a sort of independent piece, witch you can reuse
Another advantage is your code looks much nicer, then giant html page

The main questions to understand components are: how to pass information into component and how to
get out information from it, how they actually connected together and to outside world?
Data down, action up
from high-level component to low-level layer

{{}} interpolation means whatever variable you have inside component (.ts file), you can use it in the
template
[ngModel]

Lazy Loading (Angular 4)
it is a technique that allows you to render components asynchronously when a certain route is activated.
This can help with the initial loading performance of an angular app

Building with Angular CLI:
ng new lazy-demo --routing

ng g module lazy --flat
ng g lazy-parent --module lazy
ng g lazy-child --module lazy
(this will automatically assign these components to the lazy module)
