 TypeScript was created by Microsoft when they wanted to created something with component-based
architecture, but there were no features available in javascript to support their dream, so
 they create a TypeScript that has strong typing, some of the class features, some new structures.
 So when you write your code in typescript it transpile into whichever version of javascript

by TS:                                          by JS:
 enum list { tomato, potato, onion };             "use strict";
                                                   var list;
                                                    (function (list) {
                                                      list[list["tomato"] = 0] = "tomato";
                                                      list[list["potato"] = 1] = "potato";
                                                      list[list["onion"] = 2] = "onion";
                                                    })(list || (list = {}));
 ;
TS also provide:
interface Profile {
        name: string;
        id: number;
 }
